# Dictionary Chrome Extension
I often come across new words while reading online. I look them up but quickly forget them, so I built this Chrome Extension to jot down the words with their definitions and my own notes too.

### How to Use
I don't plan to publish this to the Chrome Store. However, you are welcome to download it! You'll need to retrieve a free API key from https://wordnik.com/. Once you have it, paste this value at the top of App.js to set the API_KEY variable. Then you can upload the extension to Chrome (instructions here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) and start using it!

### Possible Future Features
- quiz/flashcards made from the words in your dictionary
- include pronuciation audio
