# Dictionary Chrome Extension
(WIP)
I often come across new words while reading online. I look them up but quickly forget them, so I'm building this Chrome Extension to jot them down.

### How to Use
I don't plan to publish this to the Chrome Store. However, you are welcome to download it and use it! This section will be updated with instructions once the features are built out.

## User Stories to Be Implemented Next
* As a user, I want to be able to add words to my dictionary.
* As a user, I want to be able to add my own notes on the words in my dictionary.

### Possible Future Features
- build a quiz on words in your dictionary
- flashcards
- include pronuciation audio
