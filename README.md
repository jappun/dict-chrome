# dict-chrome
When I'm browsing online, I always come across unfamililar words. I'll look them up and skim the defintion, but later forget them. So I'm building a Chrome Extension to help me build my vocabularly.

## User Stories to Be Implemented Next
* As a user, I want to be able to add words to my dictionary.
* As a user, I want to be able to add my own notes on the words in my dictionary.

## Notes for the Future
* Add a quiz feature (e.g. match word to defintion, to a synonym)
* Include pronuncation (audio)
